HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI
This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI to provide insights into employee attrition within an organization,
The dashboard visualizes key HR metrics such as overall attrition rate, department-wise attrition rates, and the average attrition rate by department,
The analysis leverages Power BI's calculated columns, measures, and dynamic visuals to create an intuitive and interactive dashboard for HR professionals and decision-makers.

Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard allows HR teams to easily analyze and understand employee attrition patterns within the company. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the overall attrition rate, department-specific attrition trends, and average attrition by department are displayed through interactive charts and tables. This helps HR professionals identify areas of concern, track trends over time, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

Key Features
Overall Attrition Rate: The dashboard displays the total attrition rate of the organization, calculated using the number of employees who left the organization divided by the total number of employees.
Department-wise Attrition Rate: Provides insights into attrition rates across different departments within the company. The attrition rate is calculated for each department based on the number of employees who left versus the total number of employees in that department.
Average Attrition Rate by Department: This feature calculates the average attrition rate for each department, helping HR teams compare departments' retention performance.
Dynamic Filtering: Users can filter data based on date ranges, departments, or other attributes to view customized reports.
Calculated Columns and Measures: I used Power BI's calculated columns to create metrics such as Attrition Rate, Employee Tenure, and Department-wise Average Attrition Rate.
Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes interactive visuals like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for easy understanding of attrition patterns, trends, and comparisons.

Technologies Used
Power BI: The primary tool for building the dashboard.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns and measures.
Power Query for data transformation and cleaning.
Power BI Desktop for report creation and visualization.
Excel/CSV: The dataset format for employee data (imported into Power BI).

Usage
Open the HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.
Load the data (either from a file or from your organization's database).
Interact with the dashboard:
Filter data by department, date, or other criteria.
View detailed insights such as the overall attrition rate, department-wise attrition rates, and employee retention patterns.
Use slicers and other filters to adjust the data views and analyze different scenarios.
